shraddha kapoor had never imagined that her quiet weekend in mumbai would spiral into a high-stakes mission involving rare pokémon, encrypted vaults, and a betrayal that would shake the entertainment world. it all began when she received a mysterious invitation to a private auction: “opportunity of a lifetime. roaming form legendaries available. confidential.” initially she suspected it was a prank, but the seal carried the unmistakable emblem of the pokémon preservation guild, an elite underground group known to deal in rare and sometimes controversial pokémon specimens. curiosity got the better of her. when shraddha arrived at the auction—a hidden facility beneath colaba causeway—she found herself among collectors, tycoons, and even a few shady trainers with reputations for dubious trades. the host revealed the star attraction: a shiny articuno, captured decades ago and thought to be extinct in the wild. gasps echoed through the chamber. shraddha felt an electric jolt of awe. but before the bidding could begin, alarms shrieked through the hall. smoke burst from the vents. the lights flickered out. people screamed. when the emergency lamps stabilized, the articuno was gone. and in its place was a chilling note: “the ice bird belongs to the people — g.g." shraddha froze. she knew exactly who “g.g.” was: gautam gambhir, former cricketer turned rogue vigilante pokémon activist. his ideology had shifted dangerously in recent years. he believed rare pokémon should be freed at any cost—even if it meant using criminal tactics. rumors circulated that he commanded a covert squad of trained pokémon specializing in stealth extractions. within minutes, the preservation guild sealed the exits and demanded cooperation. but shraddha wasn't one to sit idle. she had her own partner pokémon hidden in her backpack: umbreon, loyal and fiercely protective. together, they slipped through a maintenance duct and pursued gambhir’s trail. the chase led them across marine drive, where gambhir’s silhouette leapt between rooftops, propelled by the swift wings of his pidgeot. umbreon darted through shadows as shraddha climbed fire escapes with a determination she didn’t know she possessed. every time she got close, gambhir seemed a step ahead, leaving taunting clues—feathers, icy footprints, and encrypted messages etched with precision. eventually the trail led to the abandoned worli sea fort, where gambhir planned to unleash articuno into the open skies. shraddha reached the fort just as his team prepared a portal device powered by rotom energy, designed to erase tracking signatures. the sea wind howled. articuno shrieked inside its containment sphere, blasting frost against the glass. shraddha confronted gambhir under the fort’s crumbling archway. he smiled darkly. “why chase me? i’m doing what your people are too afraid to do.” “you’re kidnapping pokémon,” she retorted. “that isn’t freedom.” gambhir signaled to his squad. a machamp and a greninja stepped forward, muscles tensed and ready. shraddha knew umbreon couldn’t take them alone. but she also knew gambhir underestimated her. she deployed a well-timed flash bomb—training from an action movie set unexpectedly proving useful—and umbreon struck with a perfectly aligned dark pulse, collapsing the portal generator. electric sparks spiraled across the courtyard. the containment sphere holding articuno destabilized. gambhir lunged for it, but shraddha tackled him mid-stride, pinning him against the platform railing. the sphere cracked. a bursting wave of ice exploded outward, coating the fort in shimmering frost. articuno emerged—majestic, powerful, furious. it shrieked at both of them before spreading its wings and soaring into the monsoon sky. free not by gambhir’s philosophy, and not by the preservation guild’s captivity, but by the chaos of their conflict. enforcers arrived moments later. gambhir was apprehended, shouting about liberation and destiny. shraddha, soaked in seawater and frost, watched articuno disappear into the clouds. she felt no regret. for the first time, she understood that pokémon didn’t need owners, collectors, or liberators—they needed respect. as reporters swarmed her in the aftermath, asking how she managed to thwart one of the most daring heists in pokémon preservation history, shraddha simply smiled and said: “i just followed the trail.” the world, however, wouldn’t soon forget the night the heist went wrong—thanks to one determined actor and her fiercely loyal umbreon.
